A java web project to manage courses and grades information. The project is used and managed by users with different authority as administrator, student and professor. 
The back-end is developed by SpringMVC, Spring Framework, MyBatis and MySQL. And the front-end is implemented by easyui and h-ui. This project mainly focuses on back-end, so I use easyui and h-ui templates and edited them for my back-end project according to easyui and h-ui documents.
